**final ML project:** 
The selected model is used in conjuncture with the available dataset for estimating the success percentage of first-stage payload landing on re-usable satellite launch vehicles (SLVs), and thus minimizing the cost of each launch.

**spacex_dash_app.py:**
A dashboard was created using Plotly, to visualize the effects of the various features like payload mass, booster version, launch site etc. on the success rate of landing and thus optimizing the feature selection process. 

**folium_lab:** Mapping of local assets in the proximity of the SLV launch sites and measuring the approximate distance from each asset to help decision making and success rates seamless for establishing infrastructures of satellite launchpads and simultaneously maintain public safely and security.

**House_project:** Multiple Regression and Polynomial Regression based models designed using datasets for critical parameters impacting price points of real estates. The final outcome provides the estimated price on the realty assets and the dynamic possible price change that can be levied on the assets based on the dynamic nature of the parameters under consideration.
